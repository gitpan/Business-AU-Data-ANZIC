    Business::AU::Data::ANZIC - Australian New Zealand Standard Industrial
    Classification (ANZSIC) Codes

      use Business::AU::Data::ANZIC;
  
      my $parser = Business::AU::Data::ANZIC->get('Parse::CSV');

DESCRIPTION
    Business::AU::Data::ANZIC is a module which ties the Australian New
    Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) Codes to a cpan
    namespace.

    For applications that need to capture and store information on the
    sector of the economy that a business or person operates in, this module
    provides data that can be used to specify an industry sector.

    The data is provided internally as a CSV heirachal serialization of the
    official Australian Bureau of Statistics data cube from product 1292.0.

  Using this module
    This module provides the raw data access using the Data::Package API.

    The modules will provide the data as either a raw IO::File handle, or as
    a Parse::CSV object with numeric columns, from which you can fetch rows
    that can be used to compile your task-specific list.

METHODS
    See Data::Package for API details.
